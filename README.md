# JSON-RPC done right #
a leightweight JSON-RPC client and server implementation for PHP 5

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, specification compatible and object-oriented JSON-RPC implementation for PHP.  
This version is based on the [JSON-RPC 2.0 specification proposal](https://groups.google.com/group/json-rpc/web/json-rpc-2-0).
Support for the official JSON-RPC protocol version is planned in near future.

### Project status ###
I hardly had time to work on this project during the last year, but got a brain wave just now and will try pushing it to 2.0.0.
The thing that troubled me the most was that the current API is not very usable (you will agree, i think, especially when looking at the examples below).  
I am trying to solve this with a completely new API (see [proposal](https://github.com/marcelklehr/tivoka/wiki/2.0.0-API-proposal)), which is already committed but still leaves some work to be done (e.g. some remote interface for native interaction with remote server). Stay tuned!
