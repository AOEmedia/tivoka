Tivoka
======

A leightweight JSON-RPC client and server implementation for PHP.
Copyright (C) 2011  Marcel Klehr <marcel.klehr@gmx.de>


The Goal
--------
JSON-RPC is the alternative for complicated data type handling and unintuitive
data structure in XML-RPC. Since JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) natively
supports string, integer, float and array data types it's much more suitable
for a remote procedure protocol.
The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use and specification compatible
JSON-RPC implementation for PHP.
(This version is based on the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification proposal.)

How it works
------------
With Tivoka, you can easily set up a server, which can either simply port all the
methods of a given PHP object or provide access to a specific list of various PHP callbacks.
Performing a JSON-RPC request isn’t difficult either: Just give the URL of the server,
send a request, a notification or even a batch and get the result immediately.

Using Tivoka
------------
If you are about to use it in your project you will simply have toinclude 'tivoka.php'
in the root directory of Tivoka.
For a quick introduction how to use Tivoka check out the 'sample/' directory
and explore the samples.
