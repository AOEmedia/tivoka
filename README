Tivoka
A leightweight JSON-RPC client and server implementation for PHP

The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use and specification compatible JSON-RPC implementation for PHP.
This version is based on the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification proposal.
If you are about to use it in your project you will simply have to include 'tivoka.php' in the root directory of Tivoka.
For a quick introduction how to use Tivoka have a look at the 'sample/' directory and explore the samples.
